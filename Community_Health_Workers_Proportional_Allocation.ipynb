It shows that what you choose to prioritize greatly impacts where care would be sent. We can define communities in greatest need in many ways: we can think about our current crisis and send people to where the COVID19 pandemic rages most fiercely; we can think of long term measures of social and economic inequality embedded in metrics like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index; we can focus on the places with too many people dying too young and use the County Health Rankings Years-of-Potential-Life-Lost measure; we can think of joblessness and how the pandemic has thrown many into unemployment and target our resources in this way. \n",
